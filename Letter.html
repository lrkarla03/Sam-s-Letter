    <h2>My Dearest Sam,</h2>
  </div>
  
  <div class="content">
    <p>I've been sitting here for quite a while, attempting to come up with words that'll explain everything I want to say.

      Let me start this off by saying that I love you. Unconditionally. Not merely the superficial manifestations of who you appeared to be, but the very essence of your being. You. Who transcends mere labels and names. It's you— the very core of your existence— that captivates my soul completely.
      
      These last few days have been.. quite something. And I don't mean that in a bad way. In the beginning, yes. At first I thought I'd lose you completely. And the thought of that.. Well. It broke my heart. And my mind. And to be quite frank with you, the rest of everything that happened after that really didn't affect me. I was honest when I said I suspected it for a long time. The first time was when you saw my messages to Colby. When I said that I thought you'd always hate me for what I'd done. You said you had something to tell me, but you weren't ready. I had a hunch there. And then when you told me the one day that you had to tell me something. And that you would have to beg for forgiveness one day. I knew then. And I didn't want to accuse you of anything, in case I was wrong, but I tried my very best since then to make it absolutely clear that I love you no matter what. It didn't matter to me. I knew you'd tell me someday. Or it would come out in a way. But my point is, it never mattered to me. You are my soulmate. You are my person. Nothing would ever change that. And I want you to know that. You're still my baby. My princess. My wife. My best friend. My forever and a day. I am not sad. I am not upset. The only thing I am is happy. Happy that you told me. And that you're giving me a chance to continue to love you. 
      
      
      These last few days I've fallen in love with you all over again. It's been the greatest thing. Getting to know you. Inside and out. Just stopping for a moment and really... getting to know you. And I love you. Maybe even more than I did before. And less than I will love you in the future. You are still the same person, yes, but I am so grateful for the fact that we can just sit and talk and I have the chance to really learn everything about you. Thank you for that. Thank you for staying. I don't care how selfish you believe that to be. But I love you, Sam.. If I haven't made that clear before, I love you and I want to be with you. You have my heart. You always have. Life with you.. God, life with you is sweet. And soft. and lovely. It's my favourite thing. You are my favourite everything. My favourite person, my favourite memory, my favourite part of being alive. These last few days I've just been realising it again. More and more. I love existing with you. You are the embodiment of all that is beautiful in this world. I want you to know that. You. As you are. And you don't need to earn my love. You already have it. You have my whole heart. And if you'll have me, too, I'd very much like to exist with you forever. And a few days, of course. </p>
    <p>With all my Love,</p>
